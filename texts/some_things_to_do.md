# Matter in 2023-09-13

Supposedly, they want to entail us to achieve further than our current goal. If
there's no methodology, the program won't work. The methodology was useful in
my teacher's labor. What we own is simply information left from what has been
documented in several websites.

# Requirements for the project we're working

 * We must build a product according to the methodology
 * Upgrade the program by having the teacher's requirements as a context
 * Answer the questions with the purpose of having the necessary data which
 help us to show the project the way to the goal.
 * Demarcate the project (Where to start and where to stop)
 * To know what are we going to deal in order to give an answer to the
 questions we have in our heads

# What do I think about that?

I think that, this thing is necessary to build-up big projects that someone may
consider as an important tool to deal with something.

One thing that I consider from this schema, is that I want to fix the devices
that my family (Including me) break down. And the only thing that I want to
build is an assistance which helps me to know what pieces of those devices are
damaged (Something that RMS tried to do with his laser printer in 1980; for
more information,
[check this book out](https://foo.be/docs-free/FreeAsFreedom-Stallman.pdf) in
the first chapter)

# Some situations in 2023-09-18

We take a part of a script and later, we do some data-science and check what's
happening with the script and then verify the situations by then, insert or some
extra parts to make it better. We must be careful if something is working before
it gets used in production.

Now that we have the script working on an environment, we have to build a
situation where the program is doing its job in a massive way... And as what
Steven He said before, "At the end of the day, all the people (investors of a
fictional company) see are these numbers. And if enough people believe they're
real, they become real because they're addicted" so we can get a huge amount of
money and people being pleased because of your program, even if it works like
the best program. It is considered as an alternative to a situation where the
clients (consumers) can have everything working fine.

## My opinion

That's sh\*t. It's just a simple way to earn money and destroying everything
step by step. Because, you can get something by uploading your project online
(of course) but then, What would happen if that program contains special
information? The ones who read the inner code of the program can take into
account that data to make you fall down when you harm someone. And if the
inner code is closed to the rest of the people, it becomes a private
software that works like cr\*p.

Don't I remember what RMS has sung? "Join us now and share the software"
